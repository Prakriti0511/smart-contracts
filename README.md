## Overview

This project includes:
- Various smart contract implementations.
- Demonstrates functionality such as token creation, fund management, and more.
- Uses industry best practices in Solidity.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Hardhat**
- **MetaMask** or any other Ethereum wallet for testing

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prakriti0511/smart-contracts.git
   cd smart-contracts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Hardhat by editing the `hardhat.config.js` file to include your network details.

4. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Usage

1. Deploy a smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

2. Interact with deployed contracts using the scripts in the `scripts/` folder or via the Hardhat console:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat console --network <network_name>
   ```

3. Use tools like **Remix**, **Truffle**, or **Ethers.js** for further interaction.

## Testing

Run tests using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
